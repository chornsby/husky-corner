# husky-corner

`husky-corner` is a collection of small tools for my wife to automate repetitive
aspects of her work.

These are easy to distribute to her via a single-page app usable in the browser.
Since the tools are highly specific it isn't likely that they will be useful for
others, but they are easy to host on GitHub Pages.
